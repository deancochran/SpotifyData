                            The Playlist
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Info-graphic
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    Using all three of the visuals will be helpful for you to mold your ideal playlist.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The visuals are capable of being interacted with, feel free to move you mouse around the screen and enjoy the bubbles and colors.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The color of each song represents the songs positivity of a song (The closer the color is to green, the more positive a song is; the closer the color is to purple, the more negative a song is.)
                            <ul>
                                <img src='scale.png' width="1100">
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The size of each song represents the songs energy (More energetic songs have larger bubbles.)
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    To start the program, start by selecting a single genre and press 'Search' Butoon located with the 'Action' buttons
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    If the program ever seemes not to be working correctly, simply press the 'Reset' Button located with the 'Action' buttons
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Fun fact! I've never broken the program so hard that the reset button won't work. Therefore, just press reset if your ever unsure about something you are doing
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    To hone your playlist search select more drastic filter options.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                           Try combining filters, utilize your options to create the ultimate playlist.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
